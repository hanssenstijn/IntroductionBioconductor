## Project
This project has multiple objectives:
1. Set up Node.js application
2. Check health application - Ping Pong connection
3. Mockup data - response: all the mockup data
4. Database connection - response: all the data from both tables
5. SQL calls - response: specific row (SELECT WHERE)
6. SQL calls - response: combine data from tables (SELECT INNER JOIN)
7. Using Testframework - asynchronous testing
8. Documentation of APIs
